# GTK4-Autotools

A very basic bare-bones C project template using GNU Autotools as a build system, with GTK4 included.

## Setup
1. Run `autoconf -i` (preferably: `autoconf -vi`) to generate your `configure` file.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build`.
3. Run `configure` from the build directory.
4. `make`

Comment/PR for improvements or changes.
